1. The objective of the game is to guess the code generated by the computer in 
   not more than 10 guesses.

2. For every guess,
	'#' represents number of numbers at correct position
	'$' represents number of numbers that exist in the code.

3. Example: If correct code is:			2 4 3 1 
	    and guess entered is : 		4 6 3 2
	    so output would be:      		#$$

4. The code would have distinct numbers from 1 to 6.

5. To enter the code, press space after each number and enter after the complete guess.
